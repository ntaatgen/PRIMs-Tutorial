# PRIMs-Tutorial

NOTE: The tutorial is in the process of being updated for the upcoming Spring School in April 2019.
Units 1-3 have been updated, more will be added later.

The powerpoint files still need to be updated.

This is the tutorial for the PRIMs cognitive architecture.

It has the application itself (for MacOs X), just unzip it and it is ready to run, a pdf-file with the tutorial text, several directories
example models, and Powerpoint presentations used for teaching.

The source code for PRIMs is also on Github: see ntaatgen/PRIMs
